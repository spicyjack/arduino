Arduino Life library

- Create two empty arrays- one that's populated, one that's empty
- Use the populated array to determine how the empty array is filled out
- Discard the populated array, the newly populated array becomes the template
  for the next Life generation

Testing

- Test the order of cell computation?  A new cell should not be calculated
  until the next round
- Underpopulation test - A cell w/fewer than 2 live neighbors should die
- Overpopulation test - A cell with more than 3 live neighbors should die
- Next Gen cell test - A cell with 2 or 3 neighbors should live to the next
  generation
- New cell test - A new cell is created whne 3 surrounding cells are populated

API
- get_neighbors() - returns a list of populated neighbor cells
- calc_cells() - calculate—ï a group of cells, returns the results as an array
  of cells
- dump_to_serial - dumps the array of cells to the serial line as a matrix for
  human consumption

Underpopulation tests
X = live cell
* = cell being checked
. = dead cell

x.      x.x     x*      x*
.*      .*.     .x      xx
dies    lives   lives   dies
